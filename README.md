Space Invaders game created with Unity 

Hello! 
Here is my implementation of canonical game "Space Invaders" using Unity. 

**After starting the game you'll see start screen:**

**After pressing the only button on the screen, you'll see the game, so here is the tip to playing:** <br />
*You can move your ship by left/right arrows or A/D keys;* <br />
*You can shoot a lazer at your enemies by mouseclick or by pressing Space key;* <br />
*For every killed invader, you get 100 points and 400 for killing Mystery Spaceship* <br />
*If you run out of lives or invaders reach your bunkers, you lose your planet to aliens, sorry!* <br />

**Have Fun!**

**When you win or lose, you'll see you score, your highscore and two options:**
